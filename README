What is this I don't even..?
----------------------------

``pwhich`` is a command-line tool that will tell you 
where a python module can be found.

So, for example::
    
    $ pwhich.py django
    /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/django

Why is that useful, I hear you ask?  Well, if you've ever decided you needed to
take a look at the source for a module, and found yourself scrabbling around
trying to find exactly where it was installed  (now was it /usr/lib/pymodules?
or /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages? or /usr/local/lib/hadleys/hope? )...

I think you'll agree a quick ``vim `pwhich.py` mymodule`` is a great convenience!


Installation
------------

    pip install pwhich
